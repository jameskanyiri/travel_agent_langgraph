# 🧳 Cross-Border Travel Assistant

This project uses **LangGraph** to create an AI assistant that helps users understand travel documentation when moving between two countries. The assistant provides guidance on:

1. 🛂 **Visa Requirements**  
2. 🪪 **Passport Requirements**  
3. ⚠️ **Travel Advisories**  
4. 📄 **Additional Documents**

---

## 🧩 Configurable Agent Use Case

The assistant is fully configurable — you can change its behavior or use case by modifying the `Configuration` class in the codebase.

Here’s what you can customize:

- 🧠 **Assistant Role** – Redefine its purpose (e.g., from travel assistant to legal, health, or job application helper).
- 📄 **Output Structure** – Format the assistant’s responses however you'd like.
- 🔎 **Search Settings** – Control how many search queries/results are used.
- 🌀 **Reflection Steps** – Tune the number of reasoning iterations.
- ✅ **Include Search Results** – Enable/disable LLM visibility into search output.
